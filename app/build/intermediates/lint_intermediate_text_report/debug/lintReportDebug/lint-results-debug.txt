D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\build.gradle:12: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with,
   various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application
   continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the
   targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the
   UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\src\main\java\com\zimuzhedang\subtitleblocker\platform\KeepAliveService.java:122: Warning: Found dynamic locale changes, but did not find corresponding Play Core library calls for downloading languages and splitting by language is not disabled in the bundle configuration [AppBundleLocaleChanges]
            config.setLocales(new LocaleList(locale));
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AppBundleLocaleChanges":
   When changing locales at runtime (e.g. to provide an in-app language
   switcher), the Android App Bundle must be configured to not split by locale
   or the Play Core library must be used to download additional locales at
   runtime.

D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\build.gradle:7: Warning: A newer version of compileSdkVersion than 34 is available: 36 [GradleDependency]
    compileSdk 34
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\build.gradle:45: Warning: A newer version of androidx.appcompat:appcompat than 1.6.1 is available: 1.7.1 [GradleDependency]
    implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1"
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\build.gradle:51: Warning: A newer version of androidx.core:core-ktx than 1.12.0 is available: 1.13.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation "androidx.core:core-ktx:1.12.0"
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\build.gradle:55: Warning: A newer version of org.hamcrest:hamcrest than 2.2 is available: 3.0 [NewerVersionAvailable]
    testImplementation "org.hamcrest:hamcrest:2.2"
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NewerVersionAvailable":
   This detector checks with a central repository to see if there are newer
   versions available for the dependencies used by this project. This is
   similar to the GradleDependency check, which checks for newer versions
   available in the Android SDK tools and libraries, but this works with any
   MavenCentral dependency, and connects to the library every time, which
   makes it more flexible but also much slower.

D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\src\main\res\values\themes.xml:8: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 21 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
        <item name="android:statusBarColor" tools:targetApi="l">?attr/colorSurface</item>
                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:6: Warning: Possible overdraw: Root element paints background @color/page_bg with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is @style/Theme.SubtitleBlocker) [Overdraw]
    android:background="@color/page_bg">
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_usage.xml:5: Warning: Possible overdraw: Root element paints background @color/page_bg with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is @style/Theme.SubtitleBlocker) [Overdraw]
    android:background="@color/page_bg">
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Overdraw":
   If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a
   custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme
   background will be painted first, only to have your custom background
   completely cover it; this is called "overdraw".

   NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated
   with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently
   doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can
   incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then
   wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

   If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should
   consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using
   that theme instead of a root element background.

   Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you
   want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better
   performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that
   resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

    <dimen name="overlay_snap_threshold">15dp</dimen>
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
   ,

   Available options:

   **skip-libraries** (default is true):
   Whether the unused resource check should skip reporting unused resources in libraries.

   Many libraries will declare resources that are part of the library surface; other modules depending on the library will also reference the resources. To avoid reporting all these resources as unused (in the context of a library), the unused resource check normally skips reporting unused resources in libraries. Instead, run the unused resource check on the consuming app module (along with `checkDependencies=true`).

   However, there are cases where you want to check that all the resources declared in a library are used; in that case, you can disable the skip option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UnusedResources">
           <option name="skip-libraries" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:289: Warning: Missing autofillHints attribute [Autofill]
                    <EditText
                     ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Autofill":
   Specify an autofillHints attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher
   or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app
   can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the
   meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing
   usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc.

   The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined
   values like 'username' for a username or 'creditCardNumber' for a credit
   card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the
   AUTOFILL_HINT_ constants in the View reference at
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.

   You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an
   importantForAutofill attribute on that view or a parent view. See
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportant
   ForAutofill(int).

        android:clickable="true" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "KeyboardInaccessibleWidget":
   A widget that is declared to be clickable but not declared to be focusable
   is not accessible via the keyboard. Please add the focusable attribute as
   well.

D:\project\zimuzhedang\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:289: Warning: Missing accessibility label: provide either a view with an android:labelFor that references this view or provide an android:hint [LabelFor]
                    <EditText
                     ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LabelFor":
   Editable text fields should provide an android:hint or, provided your
   minSdkVersion is at least 17, they may be referenced by a view with a
   android:labelFor attribute.

   When using android:labelFor, be sure to provide an android:text or an
   android:contentDescription.

   If your view is labeled but by a label in a different layout which includes
   this one, just suppress this warning from lint.
